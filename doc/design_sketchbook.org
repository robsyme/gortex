#+TITLE: Gortex Design Sketchbook
* Gortex

  This is an outline of my thinking when writing the gortex scripts. I
  know that I'll probably have to change the name at some point.

** Storing Kmers Using big.Int

   I want to be flexible in the size of kmers wer store to ensure we
   stay compatible with cortex-var (whose binary files we are reading).

   Each kmer will be stored in a bitstring, allowing two bits per base.
   Two bits per base allows us to store A, G, T and C. Having the space
   to store only four possible nucleotides does mean that we'll
   probably have to throw out kmers that include Ns. I may relax the
   requirement in the future but it would mean that we have to allow 3
   bits per base which might get expensive.

   The Go standard library includes the package [[http://golang.org/pkg/math/big/][big.Int]] which is
   designed to store large multi-precision numbers. To store a large
   number, the package creates a slice of [[http://golang.org/pkg/math/big/#Word][Words]] large enough to store
   the value. It includes many helpful funtions that operate across
   this slice of words, including bit-shifting operators [[http://golang.org/pkg/math/big/#Int.Lsh][Lsh]] (left
   shift) and [[http://golang.org/pkg/math/big/#Int.Rsh][Rsh]] (right shift).

   To store our Kmers in these word slices, we encode each base in two
   bits like so:

   [[file:img/2bit_binary_encoding.svg]]

   We have two options for how we store the nucleotides. The examples
   here are using 32-bit words to that the figure is readable, but
   most systems will be using 64-bit words. Let's consider storing the
   4-mer 'ACGT'.

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
   [[file:img/endianness.svg]]

   The cortex-var program stores its kmer values as little-endian word
   slices in the style of option #2, so I think that it's best we
   follow suit. It also makes it easier to store small kmers as small
   values, which makes some debugging and development easier.

   We're working with coloured graphs, so each kmer needs to store not
   only the nucleotides that it represents, but also how many times it
   was seen for each colour. Cortex-var also helpfully calculates the
   incoming and outgoing endges for each colour too, so we'll store
   that.

   To store the coverage value, we're likely to need more than an
   8-bit uint (max value 255), so we'll use a uint32 (maximum coverage
   value of 4,294,967,295 - plenty).

** Strandedness

   DNA strandedness presents a significant problem. Let's consider
   representing the sequence "TACGACGTCGACT", represented below with
   both strands.

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
   [[file:img/demo_sequence_onestrand.svg]]

   Each kmer has up to two possible representations (the forward and
   reverse strand.

   I think that we will have to store both strands in the one graph.
   This is a bit of a pain becaus it almost doubles the size of the
   graph instantly. Even with the doubling, the compression probably
   makes it worthwhile.

   Let's say we have the graph from the sequence above. I've prepended
   the '$' symbol so that the whole sequence is represented in an
   edge. Note that only the last character in the edge is shown.

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
   [[file:img/demo_sequence_forward_graph.svg]]

   Let's not forget that this sequence also has a reverse-complement
   and we can construct a graph for this sequence also.

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
   [[file:img/demo_sequence_reverse_graph.svg]]

   We can combine these to get the graph below. Note that I've removed
   the edge labels for clarity.

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
   [[file:img/demo_sequence_combined_graph.svg]]

   From here, we can construct the BWT-inspired compressed
   representation. For an introduction to this method, see [[http://alexbowe.com/succinct-debruijn-graphs][Alex Bowe's
   excellent blog post]] on the subject.
